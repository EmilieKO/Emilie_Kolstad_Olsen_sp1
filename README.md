Semester Project

This web app is designed to keep track of staff members and delivery drivers, their information and their schedule.

## Installation

To use this application, you have to install or link to these external libraries:

- jQuery (version 3.6.0 or above)
- Bootstrap (version 4.3.1 or above)
- Bootstrap icons (version 1.9 or above)

## Code files

The source code can be found in the "Web application" folder.
Then navigate to the head section of "wdt.html", where the main javascript code is in "wdt_app.js", and the CSS code is in "wdt.css".

## Running the web app

1. Locate "wdt.html"
2. Open the file in you browser of choice

## Using the web app

The following functionality should now be available to you:

- Navigational bar, with more options on hover.
- Staff member table filled with data from an API.
- "In" and "Out" buttons updating the selected employees information.
- If the employee is late, a toast notification should appear, with further information on the employee.
- The schedule delivery table can take user input, and transfer it to the delivery board using the "Add" button.
- If a delivery driver is late, a toast notification will appear with their information.
- To remove a delivery driver's info, you can select a driver, and click "Clear"
- A digital clock is at the bottom of the page, where it displays the current date and time.

## Additional information

- Please use the format of hh:mm when you are asked to choose a time.
- I found many examples of codes I needed on google, however I never copy/pasted, I edited it all on my own.
- I got inspiration from this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gi_l-WaE-c on how to populate a table with user input.
